title: About Me

Brandon Blackburn (he/him) is a 5th-year doctoral candidate in Film and Media Studies at the University of California, Irvine. His research examines intimacy with and within the fractures of rigid structures of play. By looking at depictions of monstrosity and affects of horror through the lenses of race and queerness in playable media, he seeks to articulate both resonances and slippages between players and the games they play. His work has been published in Analog Game Studies, TOPIA, Amherst College Press, and elsewhere.
